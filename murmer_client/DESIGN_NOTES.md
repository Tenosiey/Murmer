# UI Modernization Notes

## Design Direction
- Adopted a Material 3 inspired aesthetic with a Plus Jakarta Sans typography stack to provide a clean, contemporary look.
- Created a richer set of light/dark design tokens in `src/routes/+layout.svelte`, including Material container colors, motion curves, and reusable utility classes (`surface-card`, `button-primary`, `page-container`).
- Increased elevation hierarchy using translucent surfaces, blur, and layered shadows for a softer, more spatial interface while keeping contrast ratios WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.

## Key Experience Improvements
- Rebuilt the login screen as a two-panel hero layout with clear messaging, feature highlights, and a focused sign-in card.
- Introduced a server hub dashboard with account summary, primary navigation tabs, and responsive cards for saved servers.
- Refreshed the chat workspace with elevated panels, message cards, refined action buttons, and modernized voice controls.
- Updated context menus and settings modal with glassmorphism surfaces, consistent spacing, and high-contrast controls.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Preserved focus-visible outlines, increased padding targets, and added sr-only labels for icon-only buttons.
- Ensured layouts collapse gracefully below tablet breakpoints by stacking navigation and resizing panels.
- Retained the theme toggle and WCAG-conscious color contrast for primary/secondary interactions.

## UI Modernization (October 2024)

### Reusable Component Library
Created a comprehensive UI component library in `src/lib/components/ui/`:
- **Button** - Multi-variant button with primary, secondary, ghost, and danger styles
- **Badge** - Status indicators with dot and pulse variants
- **Card** - Flexible card component with elevation variants
- **IconButton** - Optimized icon-only buttons with accessibility
- **Tooltip** - Contextual help tooltips with positioning
- **Spinner** - Customizable loading indicators

All components follow Material 3 principles with:
- Smooth micro-interactions and animations
- Full keyboard navigation support
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant contrast
- Reduced motion respect
- Consistent design tokens

### Enhanced Existing Components
- **ConnectionBars** - Gradient fills, stagger animations, semantic colors
- **PingDot** - 6 status levels with pulse animations
- **StatusDot** - Enhanced states with smooth transitions
- **LinkPreview** - Improved YouTube previews and hover effects
- **ContextMenu** - Fly-in animations, smart positioning, keyboard support

### Animation System
Added comprehensive animation utilities:
- Fade-in, slide-up, and scale-in utility classes
- Shimmer loading skeleton effect
- Consistent motion tokens (140ms short, 220ms medium)
- Smooth easing with `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`

### Documentation
- Created `UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` with complete design system documentation
- Component usage examples and props
- Accessibility guidelines
- Color system and typography scale
- Best practices and migration guide

## Follow-up Ideas
- Add Storybook for component playground and documentation
- Implement snapshot tests for critical layouts
- Create dark mode preview toggle in settings
- Add more icon components for consistency
- Expand animation library with enter/exit transitions

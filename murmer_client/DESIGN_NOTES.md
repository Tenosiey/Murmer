# UI Modernization Notes

## Design Direction
- Adopted a Material 3 inspired aesthetic with a Plus Jakarta Sans typography stack to provide a clean, contemporary look.
- Defined light and dark mode color tokens in `src/routes/+layout.svelte` to ensure consistent surfaces, accents, and depth across pages.
- Increased elevation hierarchy using translucent surfaces, blur, and layered shadows for a softer, more spatial interface.

## Key Experience Improvements
- Rebuilt the login screen as a two-panel hero layout with clear messaging and a focused sign-in card.
- Introduced a server hub dashboard with account summary, accessible actions, and responsive cards for saved servers.
- Refreshed the chat workspace with elevated panels, message cards, refined action buttons, and modernized voice controls.
- Updated context menus and settings modal with glassmorphism surfaces, consistent spacing, and high-contrast controls.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Preserved focus-visible outlines, increased padding targets, and added sr-only labels for icon-only buttons.
- Ensured layouts collapse gracefully below tablet breakpoints by stacking navigation and resizing panels.
- Retained the theme toggle and WCAG-conscious color contrast for primary/secondary interactions.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Build a shared component library (buttons, cards, inputs) to eliminate page-level duplication.
- Expand motion guidelines with subtle transitions for navigation and message state changes.
- Add snapshot tests for critical layouts to protect spacing and theming in future iterations.

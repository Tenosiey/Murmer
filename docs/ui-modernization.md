# UI Modernization Report

## Overview
The Murmer desktop client received a Material 3 inspired refresh focused on clarity, contrast, and navigation. Global design tokens now drive the typography, color, elevation, and motion system to keep light and dark themes consistent across the experience.

## Highlights by Surface
### Login
- Two-column hero layout that introduces the product value before the sign-in card.
- Feature chips reinforce security and voice capabilities with accessible iconography.
- Elevated form card with improved focus states, helper copy, and responsive spacing.

### Server Hub
- Primary navigation tabs allow quick transitions between the server list and chat view.
- Account summary card surfaces user presence with contextual quick actions.
- Tonal creation form and redesigned server cards deliver clearer affordances for join/remove flows.

### Chat Workspace
- Shared design tokens and utility classes now power elevated panels, message cards, and control surfaces.
- Icon-only buttons gained high-contrast focus rings and larger hit targets for accessibility.
- Status menus, notification controls, and pinned message previews inherit the updated tonal palette.

## System Improvements
- `src/routes/+layout.svelte` centralizes Material 3 color containers, motion tokens, and reusable utility classes (`surface-card`, `button-primary`, `page-container`).
- Shared typography styles (`eyebrow`, `headline-hero`, `body-muted`) promote consistent hierarchy across routes.
- Responsive breakpoints were retuned to keep layouts legible from 320px mobile to large desktop widths.

## Next Steps
- Continue extracting UI primitives (buttons, chips, cards) into dedicated components for re-use.
- Expand animation tokens to cover subtle page transitions and tab changes.
- Add automated visual regression coverage for login, server hub, and chat layouts.
